# cqc-cssgrid
this is a test html layout I've been workin on lately, and have now also as a test pushed onto github as some initial test project.
The layout it self is inspired by Quake Champions by By Bethesda Softworks - Thanks a lot to Bethesda and ID software for a groovy game.
and the document content is inspired by:
CSS3 Grid Fade In Animation einfach gemacht!
Codepen -> http://bit.ly/2ng0LHD
video -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MduqnQ-951k

the menu animations is inspired by:
DevTips "CSS Animations Series" on youtube
Youtube - > https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kK-cA99SA0&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4LvJ8VctoXnPI0dtE40wfid
the parts have each a seperate codepen

Thanks to those two youtuber's for making some very cool stuf avaliable.

As this is still on the codebench its still behaving weird, and the background images is only turned on as a guideline, my plane is only to use gradient fills.
